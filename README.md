# Poker Bot Experiment

This repository is just a personal test project.

I do not have a background in coding; I am simply running some tests to see how this works. Please treat this as a sandbox/hobby project.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

*   **Python 3.11+**
*   **Make** (usually available on Linux/Mac)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/crsthn-slv/poker-game.git
    cd poker-game
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

## Makefile Commands

This project uses a `Makefile` to simplify commands. Here are the most important ones:

*   `make install`: Installs all necessary dependencies.
*   `make run-console`: Runs the game in the terminal (console mode).
*   `make clean`: Cleans up temporary files.

## How to Play (Terminal)

To start a game in your terminal against the bots, simply run:

```bash
make run-console
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play. You will be able to see your cards and make decisions (Fold, Call, Raise) when it's your turn.

## Contributing

As this is a personal test project, I am not actively looking for contributions. However, feel free to fork it and play around if you are interested.

## License
